# RIPPED

## Recursive Intent Propagation using Pretrained Embedding Distances

RIPPED is a framework for bootstrapping natural language understanding in data-poor domains. It uses distance computations between pretrained sentence embeddings as a means to utilize transfer learning in challenging classification domains (many-class, challenging language, <5 labeled examples per class).

This repository contains the code used in writing my undergraduate [honors thesis](https://github.com/michaelhball/Recursive-Intent-Propagation-using-Pretrained-Embedding-Distances/blob/master/RIPPED_honors_thesis.pdf).
